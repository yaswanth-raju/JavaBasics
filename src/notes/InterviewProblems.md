# Practical Real-Time Problems Commonly Asked in Technical Interviews

Here are some practical real-time problems that are commonly asked in technical interviews, similar to the umbrella allocation problem:

## 1. Knapsack Problem

**Description**: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

**Example**: You have a backpack that can carry a maximum weight of 50 units. You have items with different weights and values. Find the optimal combination of items to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.

## 2. Job Scheduling Problem

**Description**: Given a set of jobs, each with a start time, end time, and profit, find the maximum profit subset of non-overlapping jobs.

**Example**: You have a list of jobs with their respective start and end times and profits. Determine the maximum profit you can achieve by scheduling non-overlapping jobs.

## 3. Coin Change Problem

**Description**: Given an amount and a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount.

**Example**: You have coins of denominations 1, 5, 10, and 25. Find the minimum number of coins needed to make an amount of 63.

## 4. Traveling Salesman Problem

**Description**: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

**Example**: You have a set of cities and the distances between them. Determine the shortest route that visits all cities and returns to the starting point.

## 5. Meeting Room Scheduling

**Description**: Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times, determine if a person could attend all meetings.

**Example**: You have a list of meeting intervals. Determine if a person can attend all meetings without any overlap.

## 6. Stock Buy and Sell

**Description**: Given an array of prices where the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i, find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock. You may complete as many transactions as you like.

**Example**: You have an array of stock prices. Determine the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock multiple times.

## 7. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example**: You have a string "abcabcbb". Determine the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
